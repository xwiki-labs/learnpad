This page aims to provide a cheatsheet to test the simulation scenarios currently available in the platform.

The simulator currently offers two simulate two process, each of which can be configured with two different scenarios (cases):

* SUAP - Titolo unico, which can be simulated either with case 637 or 829
* SUAP - Service Conference, which can be simulated either with case 829 or 1118

Below you well see the steps to execute each process with both cases, from beginning to end. **Please note that it does not represent a realistic simulation session**, as it purposefully indicate you to put anything (if the field is required) or leave blank (for optional fields) for fields which are not automatically validated by the platform. In a realistic session, such fields should be filled with realistic values instead.
